## About ‚ùì
This is a customized mix of Yurihikari themes, optimized for dyslexia-friendly reading and adapted for the personal use of Remi Lunnar.

The aim of this repository is to provide a simple and easy to use ricing for Garuda Linux Sway and Hyprland. This was made before the official Garuda Linux Hyprland/Sway release.


## Additional features üëç
- Waybar themes switch (The main setup I use is intentionally minimalist to help with my dyslexia, making everything cleaner and easier to navigate. However, you still get access to all official repository themes, including the Waybar themes switch.)
- Background switch using Meta+Shift+b. (Backgrounds must be in the ~/.config/backgrounds folder)
- Easily add musics to mpd with the mpd_update function ( Assuming your musics are in ~/Music )

## Important Dependencies ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Installation üîß
### Ctrl+C Ctrl+V üòè
You'll need to install the dependencies yourself.
After you installed the dependencies (some may be missing depending of your distro), just clone the repository and copy/paste the files in the .config directory :

*Example* :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lunnarknox/garuda-sway-config.git
cp -r garuda-sway-config/* ~/.config
```

Or simply pick what you need from the files, and use it in your own.

For the nwgbar icons, you can use the included script to install them (install.sh inside the nwgbar-icons folder)

Reboot and enjoy.

### Install Script ‚úàÔ∏è
**Disclaimer** : This was only tested on fresh Garuda Linux installs and EndeavorOs using community sway edition. I am not responsible for any damage the script may cause, even though it's unlikely.
Run the **install.sh** script located at the root of the repository directory to install the dotfiles and its dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lunnarknox/garuda-sway-config.git
cd ./garuda-sway-config
./install.sh
# You'll have some interactions sometime, it's not fully automatized
```

Reboot and enjoy.

This will work assuming you already have a working Desktop Environment. If you don't, make sure you install Sway/Hyprland first using official methods. I'll probably make a script to install Sway/Hyprland and the dotfiles on barebones Arch Linux Distro based installs later if I have the time.

Feel free to contribute and make a pull request if you want to add something to the script, or create your own script.

## Keybinds ‚å®Ô∏è

### Hyprland
Please, refer to this file : [Hyprland Cheatsheet](https://dotfiledocs.lightcrimson.com/en/keybinds)
Or use Meta+Shift+I to get a keybind sheet directly on your terminal.

## Waybar üìä
Swap between each version of the waybar using the paintbrush icon on the bar.
Shortcut is unavailable in Hyprland for now.

### Minimal Bar ‚¨ú

## Colors üñåÔ∏è
I'm using primarly Black Catppuccin Macchiato as my color palette or Coolors.co black suggestion. They also have lot of themes and tutorials
to install their theme and color palette into your favorite apps.

## Background Image üñºÔ∏è
DEFAULT : Using mainly March 7th or Total Black Wallpaper

https://52kards.com/shop2/1920x1080-black-solid-color-background/ ( Artist : Unkown )

Put in the ~/.config/backgrounds whatever background you want, and do Meta+Shift+b to switch between backgrounds.

## Notice üìì
I am using **Garuda Linux Sway** as my distro. Depending on your system, some stuff may not work or break.
Please be aware of that before starting using my dotfiles.

This is a fork of the original project, and as such, it contains some divergences from the main repository. Certain files have been intentionally omitted due to risk management and compliance requirements specific to this work. Please note that this is a work in constant progress, and elements may undergo significant changes based on my preferences or evolving needs. I will create separate branches if major modifications to the current files are necessary, allowing you to track and access previous versions of the work.

I am not affiliated in any way to the official Garuda Linux Team. This is a personal ricing using Garuda Linux Sway as the main distro.
